1
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:21,339
Alright, this is CS50

2
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:25,179
Harvard University's Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science

4
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:26,509
and the arts of programming

5
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:31,009
Back here on campus and beautiful Sanders Theatre for the first time in quite a while

7
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,539
So, welcome to the class

8
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,740
My name is David Malan, again

9
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,809
So my name is David Malan

10
00:01:45,809 --> 00:01:48,279
and I took this class myself some time ago

11
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,679
but almost did it

12
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:51,080
It was sophomore fall

13
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,679
and I was sitting in on the class

14
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:53,910
and I was a little curious

15
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,210
didn't really feel like the field for me

16
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,679
I was definitely a computer person

17
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:00,710
but computer science felt like something altogether

18
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,410
And I only got up the nerve to take the class ultimately

19
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,509
because the professor at the time

20
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:05,479
Brian Kernighan

21
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:08,140
allowed me to take the class pass-fail, initially

23
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,080
And that is what made all the difference

24
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,409
I quickly found that

25
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:15,340
computer science is not just about programming and working in isolation on your computer

27
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,810
it's really about problem solving, more generally

28
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,810
And there was something about homework, frankly, that was actually fun

30
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,980
for perhaps the first time in what 19 years

31
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,710
and there was something about this ability that I discovered along with all of my classmates

34
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,880
to actually create something and bring a computer to life to solve a problem

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,680
and sort of bring to bear something that I'd been using every day

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,010
but didn't really know how to harness

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,780
that's been gratifying ever since

40
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,510
and definitely challenging and frustrating like to this day, all these years later

42
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,010
you're gonna run up against mistakes

43
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,580
otherwise known as bugs in programming

44
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,680
that just drive you nuts

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,080
and you feel like you've hit a wall

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,310
but the trick really is to give it enough time, to take a step back

48
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,680
take a break when you need to

49
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,310
And there's nothing better, I dare say

50
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,180
than that sense of gratification and pride really when you get something to work

52
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,080
and in a class like this present ultimately a terms end

53
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,710
something like your very own final project

54
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,010
Now this isn't to say that I took to it 100% perfectly

55
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,510
In fact, just this, this past week

57
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,810
I looked in my old CS50 binder

58
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,080
which I still have from some 25 years ago

59
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,510
and took a photo of what was apparently the very first program that I wrote and submitted

62
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,780
and quickly received -2 points on

63
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,710
But this is a program that we'll soon see in the coming days

65
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,610
that does something quite simply, like print "Hello, CS50!"

67
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,110
in this case, to the screen

68
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,580
And to be fair, I technically hadn't really followed the directions

70
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,080
which is why I lost those couple of points

71
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,310
But if you just look at this

72
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,580
especially if you've never programmed before

73
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,380
you might have heard about programming languages

74
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,110
but you've never typed something like this out

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,110
undoubtedly it's going to look cryptic

76
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,980
But unlike human languages, frankly,

77
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,680
which were a lot more sophisticated, a lot more vocabulary, a lot more grammatical rules,

79
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,110
programming, once you start to wrap your mind around what it is and how it works

81
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,540
and what these various languages are,

82
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,410
it's so easy, you'll see after a few months of a class like this, to start teaching yourself subsequently other languages,

86
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,140
as they may come in the coming years as well.

87
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,610
So, what ultimately matters in this particular course

88
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,340
is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates,

90
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,210
but where you end up relative to yourself when you began.

91
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,810
And indeed you'll begin today.

92
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,409
And the only experience that matters ultimately in this class is your own.

94
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,539
And so consider where you are today,

95
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,409
consider perhaps just how cryptic something like that looked a few seconds ago

98
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:31,310
and take comfort in knowing, just some months from now, all of that will be within your own grasp.

101
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,580
And if you're thinking that,

102
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,280
okay, surely, the person in front of me, to the left, to the right, behind me

104
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,210
knows more than me

105
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,940
that's statistically not the case.

106
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,979
2/3 of CS50 students have never taken a CS course before,

107
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:46,810
which is to say you're in very good company throughout this whole term.

109
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:49,380
So, then what is computer science?

110
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,979
I claim that it's problem solving

111
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:55,810
and the upside of that is that problem solving is something we sort of do all the time 

113
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,310
But a computer science class, learning to program,

114
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,010
I think kind of cleans up your thoughts

116
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,479
It helps you learn how to think more methodically

117
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:05,140
more carefully, more correctly, more precisely

118
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,710
Because honestly

119
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,210
the computer is not going to do what you want

120
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,210
unless you are correct and precise and methodical

121
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,210
And so, as such,

122
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,479
there's these sort of fringe benefits of just learning to think

124
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,310
like a computer scientist and a programmer.

126
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,180
And it doesn't take all that much to start doing so.

127
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,810
This for instance is perhaps the simplest picture of computer science

129
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,739
sure, but really problem solving in general

130
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,680
problems are all about taking input

131
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,080
like the problem you want to solve

132
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,680
you want to get the solution, a.k.a. output

133
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,010
and so something interesting gotta to be happening in here

134
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,080
in here

135
00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:35,510
when you're trying to get from those inputs to output

136
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,380
Now in the world of computers specifically

137
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,510
we need to decide in advance

138
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,310
how we represent these inputs and outputs

139
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,539
we all just need to decide whether it's Mac or PCs or phones or something else

141
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,010
that we're all going to speak some common language

142
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:51,340
irrespective of our human languages as well

144
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,080
And you may very well know

145
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,180
that computers tend to speak only what language

146
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,180
so to speak

147
00:05:59,310 --> 00:05:59,940
assembly one

148
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,609
but binary too might be your goal too

149
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:05,280
In "binary", "bi" implying "two" means that the world of computers

150
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,380
has just 2 digits at its disposal, 0 and 1.

151
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,780
And indeed we humans have many more than that

152
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,280
certainly not just zeros and ones alone

153
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,680
but a computer indeed only has zeros and ones

154
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,710
And yet somehow

155
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:17,909
they can do so much

156
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:20,310
they can crunch numbers and excels and text messages

157
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,380
create images

158
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,479
and artwork and movies and more

159
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,409
And so how do you get from something as simple as a few zeros a few ones

161
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:31,539
to all of the stuff that we're doing today in our pockets and laptops and desktops

163
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,180
Well, it turns out that we can start quite simply

164
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,710
if a computer were to want to do something as simple as count

166
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,340
what could it do? While in our human world

167
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,710
we might count doing this like: "1 2 3 4 5"

168
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:45,539
using so-called unary notation

169
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,010
literally the digits on your fingers

170
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,109
were one figure represents one person in the room

171
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,080
if I'm, for instance, taking attendance

172
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,409
now we humans would typically actually count

173
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,180
1 2 3 4 5 6

174
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,080
and we'd go past just those 5 digits and count much higher

176
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,609
using zeros through nines

177
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:02,280
but computers somehow only have these zeros and ones

178
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:05,810
so if a computer only somehow speaks binary zeros and ones

180
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,109
how does it even count past the number one

182
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,409
Well here are 3 zeros, of course,

183
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,780
and if you translate this number in binary "000"

184
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,340
to a more familiar number in decimal

185
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:18,780
we would just call this 0

186
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,680
enough said

187
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,409
if we were to represent with a computer the number 1

188
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,979
it would actually be 001

189
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,580
which not surprisingly is exactly the same as we might do in our human world

192
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,909
but we might not bother writing out the 2 zeros at the beginning

194
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,479
but a computer now

195
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:34,710
if it wants to count as high as 2

196
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,280
it doesn't have the digit 2

197
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,080
and so it has to use a different pattern of zeros and ones

199
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,210
and that happens to be "010"

200
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,380
so this is not "10" with a "0" in front of it

201
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,780
it's indeed "010" in the context of binary

202
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,680
and if we want to count higher than 2

203
00:07:48,109 --> 00:07:52,080
we're going to have to tweak these zeros and ones further to get 3

205
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,380
and then if we want 4 or 5 or 6 or 7

206
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,580
we're just kind of toggling these zeros and ones

207
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:01,940
a.k.a. bits, for binary digits

208
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,140
that represent via these different patterns

209
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,940
different numbers that you and I as humans know, of course, as

210
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:08,479
the so called decimal system

211
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,609
0 through 9 deck implying 10

212
00:08:11,609 --> 00:08:12,979
10 digits, those zeros through 9

213
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,180
so why that particular pattern

214
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,340
and why these particular zeros and ones

215
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,539
well, turns out that representing one thing or the other

217
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,979
is just really simple for a computer

218
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:23,409
Why?

219
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:25,409
At the end of the day, they're powered by electricity

220
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:30,380
and it's a really simple thing to just either store some electricity or don't store some electricity

223
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,480
like that's as simple as the words can get, "on" or "off"

224
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,610
"1" or "0", so to speak

225
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:40,110
So, in fact, inside of a computer, a phone, anything these days that's electronic pretty much

228
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,780
is some number of switches

229
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,080
otherwise known as transistors

230
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,480
And they're tiny. You've got thousands, millions of them in your Mac or PC, your phone these days

233
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,280
And these are just tiny little switches that can get turned on and off

235
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,010
and by turning those things on and off in patterns

236
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,740
a computer can count from 0 on up to 7

237
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,340
and even higher than that

238
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,280
And so these switches really you can think of being as

239
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,380
switches like this

240
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,610
let me just borrow one of our little stage lights here

241
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,580
here's a light bulb

242
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,810
it's currently off

243
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,280
and so I could just think of this as representing

244
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,580
in my laptop, that a transistor or a switch representing "0"

245
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,310
but if I allow some electricity to flow

246
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,610
now I in fact have a one

247
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,380
Well how do I count higher than one

248
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,810
of course we need another light bulb

249
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,910
so let me grab another one here

250
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,780
and if I put it in that same kind of pattern

251
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,910
I don't want to just do this

252
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,380
that's sort of the old finger counting way of unary

253
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,740
just one, two

254
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,180
I want to actually take into account the pattern of these things being on and off

257
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,610
So if this was "1" a moment ago

258
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,280
what I think I did earlier was I turned it off

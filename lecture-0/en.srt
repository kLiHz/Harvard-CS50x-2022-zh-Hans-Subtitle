1
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,130
Alright, this is CS50

2
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,970
Harvard University's Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science

4
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,300
and the arts of programming

5
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,800
Back here on campus and beautiful Sanders Theatre for the first time in quite a while

7
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,330
So, welcome to the class

8
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,530
My name is David Malan, again

9
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,600
So my name is David Malan

10
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,070
and I took this class myself some time ago

11
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,470
but almost did it

12
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,870
It was sophomore fall

13
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,470
and I was sitting in on the class

14
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,700
and I was a little curious

15
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,000
didn't really feel like the field for me

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,470
I was definitely a computer person

17
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,500
but computer science felt like something altogether

18
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,200
And I only got up the nerve to take the class ultimately

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,300
because the professor at the time

20
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,270
Brian Kernighan

21
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,930
allowed me to take the class pass-fail, initially

23
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,870
And that is what made all the difference

24
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,199
I quickly found that

25
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,130
computer science is not just about programming and working in isolation on your computer

27
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,600
it's really about problem solving, more generally

28
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,600
And there was something about homework, frankly, that was actually fun

30
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,770
for perhaps the first time in what 19 years

31
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,500
and there was something about this ability that I discovered along with all of my classmates

34
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,670
to actually create something and bring a computer to life to solve a problem

36
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,470
and sort of bring to bear something that I'd been using every day

38
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,800
but didn't really know how to harness

39
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,570
that's been gratifying ever since

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,300
and definitely challenging and frustrating like to this day, all these years later

42
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,800
you're gonna run up against mistakes

43
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,370
otherwise known as bugs in programming

44
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,470
that just drive you nuts

45
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,870
and you feel like you've hit a wall

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,100
but the trick really is to give it enough time, to take a step back

48
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,470
take a break when you need to

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,100
And there's nothing better, I dare say

50
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,970
than that sense of gratification and pride really when you get something to work

52
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,870
and in a class like this present ultimately a terms end

53
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,500
something like your very own final project

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,800
Now this isn't to say that I took to it 100% perfectly

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,300
In fact, just this, this past week

57
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,600
I looked in my old CS50 binder

58
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,870
which I still have from some 25 years ago

59
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,300
and took a photo of what was apparently the very first program that I wrote and submitted

62
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,570
and quickly received -2 points on

63
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,500
But this is a program that we'll soon see in the coming days

65
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,400
that does something quite simply, like print "Hello, CS50!"

67
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,900
in this case, to the screen

68
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,370
And to be fair, I technically hadn't really followed the directions

70
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,870
which is why I lost those couple of points

71
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,100
But if you just look at this

72
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,370
especially if you've never programmed before

73
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,170
you might have heard about programming languages

74
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,900
but you've never typed something like this out

75
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,900
undoubtedly it's going to look cryptic

76
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,770
But unlike human languages, frankly,

77
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,470
which were a lot more sophisticated, a lot more vocabulary, a lot more grammatical rules,

79
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,900
programming, once you start to wrap your mind around what it is and how it works

81
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,330
and what these various languages are,

82
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:01,200
it's so easy, you'll see after a few months of a class like this, to start teaching yourself subsequently other languages,

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,930
as they may come in the coming years as well.

87
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,400
So, what ultimately matters in this particular course

88
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,130
is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates,

90
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,000
but where you end up relative to yourself when you began.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,600
And indeed you'll begin today.

92
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,200
And the only experience that matters ultimately in this class is your own.

94
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,329
And so consider where you are today,

95
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,200
consider perhaps just how cryptic something like that looked a few seconds ago

98
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,100
and take comfort in knowing, just some months from now, all of that will be within your own grasp.

101
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,370
And if you're thinking that,

102
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,070
okay, surely, the person in front of me, to the left, to the right, behind me

104
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,000
knows more than me

105
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,730
that's statistically not the case.

106
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,770
2/3 of CS50 students have never taken a CS course before,

107
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,600
which is to say you're in very good company throughout this whole term.

109
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,170
So, then what is computer science?

110
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,770
I claim that it's problem solving

111
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,600
and the upside of that is that problem solving is something we sort of do all the time
